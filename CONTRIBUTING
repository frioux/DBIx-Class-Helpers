## DDL

To Generate ddl.sql which will allow you to run prove -l use the following command:
perl -Ilib -It/lib -MTestSchema -E'TestSchema->generate_ddl; my $t = TestSchema->connect; $t->deploy'

Eventually that will be migrated into it's own Dzil plugin, but for now that should work

## Testing

To run tests against all major supported databases use:

```
$ maint/dockerprove -lr t
```

You can set DBIITEST_STARTUP to 10 or 15 to wait longer for the databases to be
ready to test against.  Default is 5s.

## Writing Tests

By default, tests will only be run against SQLite. To write tests
that will run on other DBs, use Test::Roo, and compose in the role
A::Role::TestConnect. This will lazily connect (and deploy) the
schema once the schema method is called. To run tests only if
connected, check the connected method.

For the simplest example of this, take a look at t/ResultSet/Explain.t.

## Releasing
